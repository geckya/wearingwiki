We built the orignal version of this woven wrap carries wiki in 2014 to make it easier to search for carries by wrap size or other attributes (like, "good for leaners"), featuring carry recipes, carry diagrams, and links to tutorials from the global babywearing community.

After being offline for a few years, we're working to rebuild the site. Since a lot of our original tutorial links are broken or point to inaccessible, we're starting fresh, and could use your help to identify the best tutorials around today! Please be patient as we work to get back to being fully functional. If you'd like to recommend a tutorial or a new carry, please reach out to us through [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wearingwiki) or [GitHub issue](https://github.com/geckya/wearingwiki/issues).
